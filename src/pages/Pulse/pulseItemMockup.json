     "Bitcoin hinted the test of $60,000 as soon as it registered a bearish engulfing candle which we stated yesterday when price was at $63,500. Now, we've seen price dip down to support and it'll likely range some more to resolve this uncertainty before rising higher into price discovery once again. We'd like to see $60,000 hold on the daily and weekly timeframes."
